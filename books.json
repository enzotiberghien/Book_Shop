    "description": "Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that allows the developer to write webpage faster. It is also really beneficial to make the page responsive on all devices.  Bootstrap works with a grid system that divides a row into 12 columns, which then uses the built-in bootstrap breakpoint that allow to adjust how many columns an element takes on a row depending on the breakpoint. To use bootstrap different options are possible, we can, for example, download it with npm, or include it in the html throughout the CDN. Bootstrap works with classes. We simply add classes to HTML elements. For example if we want a blue button I will add the class btn and color-primary. Bootstrap also includes built in  components such as navbar, accordion, modal etc that you can copy on their website. It is possible to customize and override the variable of bootstrap using Sass. With such components, a lot is taken care of, in the case of the navbar even some Javascript is handled, the animation when the hamburger button is clicked for instance. Bootstrap comes with a few downsides. First, It can make the html look quite bad and messy since we have a lot of different classes as attributes for our elements. Also, it give to the website a really bootstrappy look that will be similar to other website that uses it. However, this later point can be fixed if the developer customizes bootstrap with Sass. Also, it seems like Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework, but when a frontend developer is using a Javscript framework such as React, other UI frameworks such as Material UI, Ants or Tailwind seems to be quite popular. On a personal note, I like the fact that bootstrap is easy to use and allow us to create application really fast but I feel quite constrained by the framework.",

    "title": "HTML - An Introduction",
    "author": "James Horton",
  "description": "Html is a markup language that is used for the content on web pages. The styling and functionality are handled by other languages. For a starter to create an HTML document, one should include the boilerplate which starts with the !DOCTYPE and then is followed by the HTML tag on which everything else is contained. We have then the head which includes metadata, stylesheet links, and the title of the page. Then, the body of the page, where every element will be. On a web page, every small section of a page is an element, for example, the heading of a page is most likely a heading element, which is created using the tag h1, it goes from 1 to 6, 6 being the smallest heading. It is important to note that almost all HTML elements include a closing tag, which is the one that starts with a slash after the opening bracket. Some elements such as a link or an image don’t need a closing tag. The closing tag is sort of included in one tag. Another component of HTML crucial to understand is the attributes. An attribute is a property set to an element, if we take our image example again and add to it a source attribute it will look like this: src=”image/path”. In HTML, there is a way to make the code more accessible. For example, adding attributes to describe the image, that will allow the user that uses screen readers to get the information. Overall, HTML is a great markup language, easy to get started with, and that takes some experience to get used to all the good practices. It is essential to know in web development since there is no way around it. Even in front-end JS frameworks html is a component of them.",

    "description": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a style sheet language used to style the content of the webpage. Put simply, a CSS file contains the styles of HTML elements in an HTML file on which the CSS file is linked. In CSS, to style an element, we first have to select using either the element name, for example, h1, the id, or the class. Then after opening brackets we list all the styling rules that we want to apply to this element. It can be the font-size, the background-color, the width, the height, and so on. There is also more complexe way to select the elements, we can for example select a h1 part of a div by using ‘div h1’.  CSS even allows us to select the first element of a type, or the last with special selectors such as nth-of-type. We can also style elements based on a condition, such as hover. When the element is hovered by the user the styles will apply. Another component of CSS is responsiveness. Which is the idea that a page should look good on all devices and screen sizes. To do that in CSS we use media query. In a media query, if for example, we put the max-width at 600px, all the code contained in this media query will be applied when the screen or the window will be at a size below 600px. This concept allows us then to modify the styling of the page depending on the screen size. In CSS we also have the ability to create animations that can make a website more dynamic and alive. A popular example of animation is a navbar on a mobile device, when the hamburger button is clicked the mobile menu appears often with a sliding animation. Although this animation fire through javascript, it is created in CSS",

    "description": "JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser. It is often used for the functionality and dynamic parts of websites. There is a version of javascript that doesn’t run in the browser, NodeJS which is more similar to traditional programming languages. Javascript is arguably the most popular programming language in the world depending on the source, or at least in the domain of web development. It is a great language accessible for beginner since it less syntax heavy than other programming language such as Java. In Javascript you don’t have to specify variable types for instance, even thought versions of javascript such as TypeScript are more similar to java and oop languages in that sense. In the web we use mostly the DOM in javascript which represent all the html in a web page, allowing use to add event listener, create element, delete element etc. Allowing use thus to create dynamic operations on a page, example: clicking on a book to add the item on a shopping cart.  In 2015, ES6 , an important update of javascript, added a lot of changes to the language. Things that were added are for example the let and const keywords, the arrow functions, JS modules, promises, array and objects methods, class etc… Making JavaScript today a really pleasant language to work with. It is also important to note that despite the ability of javascript, many framework came with the mission of writing front-end code powered by javascript faster and using common standards. After a ‘war’ of the framework for years, React, the most popular one nowadays, makes, for example, a lot of functionality of JS easier with concepts such as components, props, states, global state etc… There is also other framework such as Angular, Svelt, or View that grow in popularity.
